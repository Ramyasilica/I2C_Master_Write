# I2C_Master_Write 

🌍 Welcome World!

Welcome to my **seventh GitHub repository** 🎉
In this repository, I have implemented an **I2C Master Write controller** using **Verilog HDL**, and its functionality is verified through **simulation waveform analysis**.

This project focuses on understanding the **I2C master write operation and its working principle**, including clock generation, data transmission, and proper timing behavior on the I2C bus.

📌 What is I2C?

**I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** is a synchronous serial communication protocol that uses only **two bidirectional lines**:
* **SCL** – Serial Clock Line
* **SDA** – Serial Data Line

It supports:
* Master–slave communication
* Open-drain signaling
* Byte-oriented data transfer
I2C is widely used to interface **sensors, EEPROMs, RTCs, and peripheral devices** with controllers.


## Project Overview

In this repository, **I have implemented an I2C Master Write operation and its working principle**.

The main objective of this project is to:
* Implement how an I2C master **writes data to a slave**
* Understand **serial data transmission**
* Analyze **SCL and SDA timing** using waveforms
* Verify correct behavior through simulation

This project explains the **complete write operation flow at RTL level**, making it easier to understand the protocol fundamentals.

##  I2C Master Write – Concept

In an **I2C Master Write** operation:
* The **master generates the clock (SCL)**
* The **master drives data on SDA**
* Data is transmitted **bit by bit**, MSB first
* SDA changes only when **SCL is LOW**
* Data remains stable when **SCL is HIGH**

This design demonstrates a **single-byte write operation** to clearly explain the protocol behavior.

## Signals Used (From Simulation Waveform)

### Control Signals

* `clk` – System clock
* `rst` – Reset signal
* `start` – Initiates the I2C write transaction

### I2C Bus Signals

* `scl` – Serial clock generated by master
* `sda` – Serial data line (open-drain behavior)

### Data & Status Signals

* `slave_addr[6:0]` – Target slave address
* `data_in[7:0]` – Data to be written
* `bit_cnt` – Tracks transmitted bits


## Working of the I2C Master Write Operation

1. System clock starts running
2. Reset initializes the controller
3. `start` signal triggers the write operation
4. Master generates the I2C clock (`scl`)
5. Slave address is transmitted serially on `sda`
6. Write data byte is sent bit-by-bit
7. `bit_cnt` tracks the 8-bit transmission
8. Data transmission completes successfully


## 📊 Simulation Results (Waveform Analysis)

From the simulation waveform:
* `scl` toggles with proper I2C timing
* `sda` follows correct open-drain behavior
* Address `0x50` is transmitted correctly
* Data `0xA5` is written successfully
* `bit_cnt` increments correctly for each bit

✅ Proper clock generation
✅ Correct data transmission
✅ Valid I2C master write operation

🧾 Conclusion

This repository demonstrates a **working I2C Master Write controller** implemented using **Verilog HDL**.
The simulation results verify correct clock generation, address transmission, and data write operation, making this project a **strong foundation for advanced I2C-based designs**.
